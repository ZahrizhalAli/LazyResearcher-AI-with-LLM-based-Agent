# Pioneering Intelligent Agents with LangChain and OpenAI GPT

This project proposes to develop an LLM-based agent that uses GPT and Langchain that will be able to reason about problems and break them into smaller sub-tasks, and it will be able to access and use tools from the real world, such as Google Search.The proposed agent could be used in a variety of applications, including Customer service chatbots, research assistants, or information retrieval tools.
